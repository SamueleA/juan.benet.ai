This is a vocabulary for the purpose of precisely defining propblems and solutions in my data management efforts. Many are standard **version control** concepts.


- **data**: information stored in digital files
- **dataset**: a meaningful collection of related **data**, usually packaged as a set of files and identified with a name.

- **git**: a popular **distributed version control system**.
- **hg**: another populat **distributed version control system**.

- **storage**: for our purposes, digital storage of files in computers.
- **bandwidth**: for our purposes, capacity to distribute files across a network, mainly the internet.

- **version**: a snapshot of files at a particular point in time. Versions are useful to trace histories of changes.
- **versioning**: storing multiple versions of a given file to enable tracing the history of changes.
- **versioning scheme**: a scheme or protocol to identify different **versions** of file.
- **version control**: techniques to store, manage, and retrieve numerous digital files, using versioning.
- **version control system** (VCS): a system (usually a software tool) used to enact, support, and simplify a particular form of **version control**.
- **distributed version control system** (DVCS): a **version control system** that operates in a distributed, decentralized fashion. Users do not need to interact with, or obtain permission from, a central authority for normal operation.
