# How to contact me

Before contacting, try these:

- For IPFS questions, try [discuss.ipfs.io](https://discuss.ipfs.io)
- For Filecoin questions, try [discuss.filecoin.io](https://discuss.filecoin.io)
- For Protocol Labs inquiries, email `contact@protocol.ai`

You can find me on these networks:

- email: `my-first-name@benet.ai` and `my-first-name@protocol.ai`
- github: [@jbenet](https://github.com/jbenet)
- twitter: [@juanbenet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet)
- keybase: [@jbenet](https://keybase.io/jbenet)

**Please Note:** These days I receive vastly more messages than I can reasonably respond to. If I don't respond, please don't take it personally. I am more likely to respond if you get an introduction from someone I know (think of it like a _proof-of-work_).
